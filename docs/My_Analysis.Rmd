This Rmarkdown file will do the analysis.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
library(TestPackage)   # load TestPackage, which includes MaxTemp data frame.
library(ggplot2)
    
ggplot(MaxTemp, aes(x=Date, y=MaxTemp)) +
  geom_line()
```
    
We see that the daily max temperature in Flagstaff varies quite a lot.
